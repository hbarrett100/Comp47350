    "- The sorted correlation dataframes above the plots give an even clearer indication of the results. We can see that the correlation between *AgeUponIntake* and the target feature is 0.059 while the correlation between *AgeUponOutcome* and the target feature is 0.054.\n",
    "- It must be noted however, that as described in section 3.6.1 of the FMLPD course textbook, continuous features that cover very different ranges should be normalised. As we are dealing with the ages of many different species of animals, normalisation would cause these two continous features to fall within a specified range while maintaining the relative differences between the values for the feature. In other words, adding a normalisation step would better represent the different between an old dog and an old racoon, for example. \n",
    "- At this stage in the assignment however, we are choosing the leave the ages at their absolute values. Later in the assignment we will have the option to implement normalisation and make a comparision.\n",
    "- The correlation between *lengthOfStay* and the outcome is -0.052. This feature will be dropped as these results show that it is likely not an indicator of the binary outcome. \n",
    "- As a result, at this stage we will drop these two features as they do not look like good predictors of the target outcome. "

    "#### 1.2.4 Interpretation of the results\n",
    "\n",
    "As we have a lot of categorical features, we will only give a brief discussion of each. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Name_Provided**: During data cleaining in homework1, we converted the values of this feature to represent whether an animal has a name of not. We can see that animals with no name are 20% more likely to have a negative outcome. This feature will be kept. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **FoundLocation**: We can see that if an animal is found in Austin, Del Valle, Pflugerville or Travis, they are 5-10% more likely to have a negative outcome than if found at the other locations. In fact, we see no negaitve outcome at any other locations. Upon examination of the counts however, we can see that this is most likely due to the cities mentioned having much larger value counts. This feature will be dropped.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Intake_Type**: We can see here that intake type has some interesting findings. As expected, all euthenasia requests result in a negative outcome. Interestingly, all animals with intake type *Wildlife* also have a negative outcome. This feature will be kept. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **IntakeCondition**: Here we can see that if an animal is sick or injured, they are 40-50% more likely to have a negative outcome. Although when looking at the absolute values, we can see that the sick or injured animals only make up approximately 10% of the total, the graphs show that this feature still seems like a strong predictor. This was accounted for in homework1 with the new feature *SickOrInjured*. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **AnimalType_Intake**: We see in this plot that animals of type *Bat* or *Other* are 100% and 65% more likely to have a negative outcome, respecitvely, than animals of type *Bird, Cat* or *Dog*. On further inspection of the value counts however, we can see that there are only 5 birds. Thus, it seems that animals of type *Cat* and *Dog* are most likely to have a positive outcome. This is accounted for in the new feature *CatOrDog* made in homework1. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## TODO finalise sex features\n",
    "- **IntakeSex: We can see that males are approximately 10% more likely to be in class 1 than females. This feature will be kept.** \n",
    "\n",
    "- **NeutereduponIntake, NeutereduponOutcome We can see that there is a strong correlation between the value unknown and class 1. We can also see a small correlation between animals not being neutered upon outcome and class 1. These two features are providing very similar information, with *NeutereduponOutcome* providing additional information. As a result, we will drop *NeutereduponIntake* and keep NeutereduponOutcome.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **BreedOriginal**: We can see that breeds of other animals are more likely to have a negative outcome. This is unsurprising after analysing the *AnimalType_Intake* plot and seeing that cats and dogs are most likely to have a positive outcome. We can also see some small correlations between other breeds and the binary outcome. For example, *Pit Bull* and *Poodle* dogs both have are more likely to be in class 1 than other breeds. Similarly, we can see that *Siamese* cats are more likely to have a negative outcome than other cat breeds. As a result, this feature will be kept. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **ColorOriginal**: We can see some small correlations here. *Grey/Silver* has the worst outcome while *White* and *LightColour* animals are most likely to be class 0. This feature will be kept. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Breed_Intake, Color_Intake**: Neither of these show any correlation with the outcome and shall both be dropped. \n",
    "\n",
    "**new features created in homework1**:\n",
    "- **SexKnown**: Upon further analysis since creating this feature in homework1, we have found that this feature is not helpful and will be dropped. \n",
    "- **CatOrDog, SickOrInjured**: Both of these new features show a strong correlation with the binary outcome and will both be kept. \n",
    "- **AgeIntake_bins**: We can see that there is no clear pattern between the age of intake bins and the binary outcome. It was expected that older animals would be more likely to have a negative outcome due to both a higher likelihood of death and a lower likelihood of being adopted. However, we can see that the greatest likelihood of a negative outcome is actually seen in the bin representing an age of 365-427 days. The likelihood of a negative outcome then decreases as the ages increase. This feature will be dropped. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Year, Month, Day, and hour features**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Categorical features were created for each of the datetime features above. As there are too many to discuss, we will discuss only the ones for which we see a correlation.\n",
    "- **Intake_Hour** is interesting. It seems that there is a much higher likelihood of a negative outcome if the animal is taken into the shelter during the night, with intake at 2am having a 100% likelihood of a negative outcome. On further investigation we can see that the number of animals being dropped in at these times is very low compared to the daylight hours. However, after doing some research into the Austin Animal center, I have learned that the opening hours are 11am-7pm. This information increases the relevance of the results seen during the night, as it is expected that the animals will not have as good an outcome if found or left at the shelter outside opening hours.\n",
    "- **Intake_Hour_bins:** As expected, the information in *Intake_Hour* is well represented in this feature. We can see that an animal that enters the shelter in the early morning (0-6am) has a 30% likelihood of being in class 1 and an animal entering the shelter in the evening/night (6pm-midnight) has a 20% likelihood of being in class 1. These findings are in comparison to the other two values which show a 5-10% likelihood of the animal being in class 1. This feature can be kept and **Intake_Hour** can be dropped.\n",
    "- **Outcome_Hour**: We can see that between 7-10am, animals have a higher likelihood of being in class 1. This is most likely due to animals who have died overnight being found in the morning once the shelter opens. This feature will be kept.\n",
    "- **Outcome_Hour_bins:** As expected, we can see that animals with a time of outcome in the late morning have a higher likelihood of a negative outcome. This feature will be kept and **Outcome_Hour** will be dropped. \n",
    "- **All other datetime related features**: For all other features created from the datetime features, no clear correlation was found upon analysis of the plots and the value counts. These will be dropped. "

    "Firstly, as described in section 7.4.3 of the course textbook 'Fundamentals of Machine Learning for Predictive Data Analytics', the most common approach to handling categorical features in regression models is to use a transformation that converts a single categorical feature into a number of continuous features that can encode the levels of the categorical feature. The levels of the categorical feature are encoded by setting the value of the new continuous feature which corresponds to the level of the categorical feature to 1, and the other continious features to 0. This is known as *dummy encoding* and is the approoach we will now take. \n",
    "\n",
    "The downside of this approach however, is that it creates a lot of new features in the dataset. In other words, as we will see in the linear regression steps below, it creates many new weights for which optimal values must be found. For this reason we carry out the second step above - remove the redundant dummies which contain no additional information. For example, we can assume that a zero in all new features implies that the original cateogrical feature had the first value. We will add the parameter *drop_first = True* in the code below in order to execute this step. "

    "#### Discussion: \n",
    "\n",
    "Before discussing the weights printout out above, we will first introduce linear regression. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Linear regression is a supervised machine learning method which is used to make predictions based on a linear relationship between the target (dependent variable) and any number of independent variables (also known as predictors).\n",
    "- It finds the line of best fit that describes the relationship between the target and predictors. \n",
    "- The linear regression formula takes the following form:\n",
    "    - $target\\_feature = w_0 + w_1 * feature_1 + w_2*feature_2 + ...+ w_n*feature_n $\n",
    "    \n",
    "- In the formula, w_0, w_1 etc are known as the **model coefficients**. \n",
    "- To create the predictive model using linear regression, these coefficients must be \"learned\". \n",
    "- As seen in the image below, this is usually done using the **least squares criterion**. In other words, we find the line of best fit that describes the relationship between the target and predictors which minimises the **sum of squared residuals** (also known as sum of squared errors).\n",
    "<br><img src=\"linear_regression.png\" style=\"width: 300px;\"/> <br>\n",
    "Source: https://github.com/justmarkham/DAT4/blob/master/notebooks/08_linear_regression.ipynb\n",
    "\n",
    "- We will now understand the image above: \n",
    "    - The **black** dots are the observed values of x and y.\n",
    "    - The **blue line** is the least squares line. \n",
    "    - The **red lines** are the residuals. These are the distances between the observed values and the least squares line. It is these residuals that we try to minimise in linear regression.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Linear regression is a regression task, which means that it predicts a numeric target feature. Thus, the output from the formula above is a continuous value that can be less than 0 and higher than 1.\n",
    "- It is important to note one of the downfalls of linear regression is that it is sensitive to outliers. However, this does not apply to our categorical features. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Discussing the coefficients learned by the model:**\n",
    "- We can see above that the intercept is 1.03 (this is w_0 in the formula above). This is the value of y when x is zero. In other words it is where the model intercepts the x axis. \n",
    "- If all other coefficients were zero, the model result would be 1.03.\n",
    "- We can see the coefficients for each feature above. They are zipped together in a single list for ease of visualisation and interpretation.\n",
    "- All of our features are categorical features which are dummy coded. Thus, care needs to be taken when interpreting the coefficients. The first value of each feature (which we have dropped) is the reference and each dummy is compared to the reference.\n",
    "- For example, we see that Name_Provided_Yes decreases by 0.086%. This makes sense as we saw in our barplot above that animals with no name are more likely to be in class 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Classification problem**\n",
    "- We are trying to solve a classification problem and thus it is important to note that the output from a linear regression model is not suited to this type of problem.\n",
    "- The output we get from linear regression is a numeric value and is not a probability. As a result, we will need to perform a thresholding step in order to convert the output into a binary classification. \n",
    "- The threshold will be as follows: \n",
    "    - Any values >= 0.5 will be cast to 1\n",
    "    - Any values <0.5 will be cast to 0"

    "    - It begins at the top of the tree and splits the features based on the information gain. As default, Scikit-Learn measures this using the Gini index.\n",
    "        - As described at https://github.com/justmarkham/DAT4/blob/master/notebooks/15_decision_trees.ipynb, the gini index is a measure of total variance across classes in a region.\n",
    "        - A dataset containing only one class will have 0 Gini impurity. \n",
    "        - The idea when building a decision tree is to choose the feature with the least Gini impurity as the root node. \n",
    "     - Thus, the tree will always split on the feature that gives the highest information gain. The feature with the highest information gain (lowest Gini impurity) will sit at the root of each decision tree.\n",
    "    - We keep repeating this process until a stopping criteria is met (such as a **maximum depth of the tree** or the **minimum number of samples in the leaf**).\n",
    "    - The farthest branch on the tree represents the end result.\n",
    "- **Random Forest:**\n",

    "    - The output of the random forest is based on the majority output of all combined decision trees. \n",
